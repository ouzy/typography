            <p>All Things D / WSJ: T-Mobile, AT&T Seek Approval of Spectrum Transfer</p>
            <p>T-Mobile USA and AT&T Inc. filed a request with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission for approval of the transfer of $1 billion in wireless airwaves AT&T promised as a result of the failure of its $39 billion bid to take over its smaller rival.</p>
            <p>AT&T said it would turn over the airwaves, or spectrum, along with $3 billion in cash to T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom AG after pulling out of the deal as opposition mounted from the FCC, Justice Department, state attorneys general and rival carriers.</p>
            <p>I’ve never seen a better break-up deal.</p>

          <div id="body-text">
            <p>A few days ago, the tech blogosphere more or less blew up after learning that software company Carrier IQ sent a rather nasty cease-and-desist letter to an XDA developers member. The grounds ? The XDA member in question, Trevor Eckhart, had discovered and exposed Carrier IQ’s tracking software residing in Android handsets. If you have never heard of Carrier IQ, it’s quite all right, few have. The pre-loaded code is ostensibly able to track everything that happens on your device, without the user being able to opt in or out, remove or disable. If you were curious of what it can track, here’s a quick list: keyboard keystrokes, receiving / sending a text message, button presses, whether your screen is on or off, and calls. Scary, isn’t it?</p>

          <div id="body-text">
            <p>Android is free. Android is a platform. Anyone can use it.</p>
            <p>Ever since its genesis in 2007, Google has gone out of its way to drive that point home. That strategy is a good way to — by sheer force — increase marketshare and, by translation, mindshare. So it’s a bit ironic when it looks like the most interesting Android tablet on the market is working very hard to not identify itself as a tablet running Android.</p>
            <p>Yes, the Amazon Kindle Fire is indeed an Android tablet at its core, but it’s more or less treating that factoid like a red-headed step child. If you head to the Kindle Fire product page and do a quick Splat-F (or Control-F for you Windows people) search, there is but one mention of Android on that entire page.</p>

          <h1 id="headline">The Death of the Courier Broke My Heart, But I’m Still Optimistic</h1>
          <div id="body-text">
            <p>The confirmation that the Microsoft Courier tablet project was scrapped broke my heart, as I’m sure it did for most people. It looked so promising, so refreshing, so… good. While I may be saddened that the product never came to fruition, I’m still optimistic.</p>
            <p>We were so graciously privileged to actually get leaks of an R&D (Research and Development) project, from Microsoft of all people. Most of the R&D stuff never gets leaked, let alone from a big company. That’s exactly why we’re complaining: we actually got a leak. Had we not have gotten a leak, we would not have been any the wiser to the Courier’s birth and demise. Every company (and I mean every) has wild R&D projects that they conduct. That’s how Sony’s Playstation Move motion-controller came to be, and I could go on and on with the examples. Companies give their engineers some money and let them go nuts and that’s how they concoct the products you hold in your hands this very second and the future ones you’ll aspire to own. If the projects don’t ever see the light of day, and most of them never do, you’ll get bits and pieces of that idea / concept that’ll live on in a future product.</p>

            <p>Don Daglow, Stormfront Studios:</p>
            <p>"There are lots of them. If you look at Thatgamecompany. All three of the games that they’ve shipped have impressed me. Her original producer and I are dear friends, and when flOw came out, I was in his office and he just hands me the controller. flOw is completely non traditional. I loved it, and he said, ‘I’m glad you do, because I just signed them to a three project deal.’</p>
            <p>I think the Bioshock series is great. I think there’s a lot of great work going on. I think what’s cool now is you have all these different strands of really strong work being done. You have traditional large-scale console games like the Bioshock series. You have online masssively multiplayer games, like the new Star Wars game. Not that World of Warcraft is a tired old thing, you’ve got innovation there. You’ve got what would have been called “experimental” games like the stuff Thatgamecompany is doing, but they’re doing it for Sony. Here’s Sony, a mega-company paying for those projects.</p>
            <p>I don’t think there’s a rarity of art. I think there’s a plethora of really wonderful work being that I respect as as art."</p>
